              Suitable reaction cells are critical for operando near ambient pressure (NAP) soft x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) studies. They enable tracking the chemical state and structural properties of catalytically active materials under realistic reaction conditions, and thus allow a better understanding of charge transfer at the liquid–solid interface, activation of reactant molecules, and surface intermediate species. In order to facilitate such studies, we have developed a top-side illuminated operando spectro-electrochemical flow cell for synchrotron-based NAP-XPS/-NEXAFS studies. Our modular design uses a non-metal (PEEK) body, and replaceable membranes which can be either of x-ray transparent silicon nitride (SiN
              
                x
              
              ) or of water permeable polymer membrane materials (e.g. Nafion
              TM
              ). The design allows rapid sample exchange and simultaneous measurements of total electron yield, Auger electron yield and fluorescence-yield. The developed system is highly modular and can be used in the laboratory or directly at the beamline for operando XPS/ x-ray absorption spectroscopy investigations of surfaces and interfaces. We present examples to demonstrate the capabilities of the flow cell. These include an operando NEXAFS study of the Cu-redox chemistry using a SiN

	abstract = {Hydrogen has emerged as a promising energy source for low-carbon and sustainable mobility purposes. However, its applications are still limited by modest conversion efficiency in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) within fuel cells. The complex nature of the ORR and the presence of strong electronic correlations present challenges to atomistic modelling using classical computers. This scenario opens new avenues for the implementation of novel quantum computing workflows. Here, we present a state-of-the-art study that combines classical and quantum computational approaches to investigate ORR on platinum-based surfaces. Our research demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of implementing this workflow on the H1-series trapped-ion quantum computer and identify the challenges of the quantum chemistry modelling of this reaction. The results highlight the great potentiality of quantum computers in solving notoriously difficult systems with strongly correlated electronic structures and suggest platinum/cobalt as ideal candidate for showcasing quantum advantage in future applications.},

              Quantum simulation of chemistry and materials is predicted to be an important application for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices. However, at present, developing and studying algorithms for these problems can be difficult due to the prohibitive amount of domain knowledge required in both the area of chemistry and quantum algorithms. To help bridge this gap and open the field to more researchers, we have developed the OpenFermion software package (
              www.openfermion.org
              ). OpenFermion is an open-source software library written largely in Python under an Apache 2.0 license, aimed at enabling the simulation of fermionic and bosonic models and quantum chemistry problems on quantum hardware. Beginning with an interface to common electronic structure packages, it simplifies the translation between a molecular specification and a quantum circuit for solving or studying the electronic structure problem on a quantum computer, minimizing the amount of domain expertise required to enter the field. The package is designed to be extensible and robust, maintaining high software standards in documentation and testing. This release paper outlines the key motivations behind design choices in OpenFermion and discusses some basic OpenFermion functionality which we believe will aid the community in the development of better quantum algorithms and tools for this exciting area of research.},
